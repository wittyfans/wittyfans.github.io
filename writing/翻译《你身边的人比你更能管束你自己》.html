<h1 id="译《你身边的人比你更能约束你自己》"><a href="#译《你身边的人比你更能约束你自己》" class="headerlink" title="译《你身边的人比你更能约束你自己》"></a>译《你身边的人比你更能约束你自己》</h1><p>大部分人如何选择同龄伙伴的呢，社会心理学上有一些有趣的研究，他们发现儿童和青少年，甚至是成年人，选择朋友时往往是通过彼此接近的距离，而不是志同道合。<br>甚至在大学教室，你会和谁交朋友呢？一开始，不会是那个和你有着相同人格与爱好的人，而是实实在在坐在你旁边的那一位。</p>
<p>社会经济学有大量的研究显示，一个人的经济地位，很大程度上可以通过他生活的地方来定义。在某些城市，你会有很好的机会去改善自己的财物状况，而在另外的地方，这种机会几乎为零。</p>
<p>简单来说，你身边所处的环境，对你有着巨大的影响。正如Jim Rohn说：“与你在一起时间最多的五个人，代表了你的水平”,Yahoo！的执行官所言：“关系网就是价值网”。</p>
<p>如果你觉得自己实现目标的时候总是卡住，看看你的周围。大部分的人从来只是被动的接受任何自己选择的环境，他们有一种被心理学家称作”external locus of control”，他们相信自己所处的外部因素会支配着他们生活的方向，但他们从不关心那个最终会影响自己的环境。</p>
<ul>
<li>谁是你身边最亲密的人？  </li>
<li>他是怎么成为你的好伙伴的？</li>
<li>是自然认识的还是出于某种目的？</li>
<li>他们让你成为更好的自己了吗？</li>
<li>或者，他们让你更堕落？</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="最快的方式改变人生"><a href="#最快的方式改变人生" class="headerlink" title="最快的方式改变人生"></a>最快的方式改变人生</h2><p>如果你想要改变人生轨迹，你需要让你身边的朋友都是比你优秀的人，对自己更严格要求的人，如Tony Robbins所说，你的人生就是你对自己的标准的反映。大部分人都愿意忍受不健康的关系，糟糕的财物状况，讨厌的工作，如果不这样，这些事情可能会从他们生命中消失。</p>
<p>对个人成长和改变正确的方法是施加更多的意志、提高自己的观念、或者勇敢一些，这样，所有这些事情都会各得其位。但如果你要追求的目标，与你现在所处的环境完全相悖，你的人生一定会是一场艰苦、不平等的战斗。</p>
<p>更好更快的途径是坚定的改变自己的环境，比如，我有一个朋友Nate，成功的房地产投资者，他也卖一些学区房。</p>
<p>尽管收入四位数以上，他确是一个极度节俭的人。很多年了，他都是开着一辆90年代的beat up的Toyota Camery，这车英里数高的难以置信却还能跑，但这辆车并不能给他在他客户面前带来自信。</p>
<p>他决定升级他的车子以适应他的业务目标以及对生活的愿景，他花了110000美元买了一辆特斯拉。</p>
<p>做了这项投资之后，然后发生了四件有趣的事情：</p>
<ol>
<li>Nate常在Facebook活跃，在这之前他经常在上面谈论他着手处理的事情，或教一些理财知识。换车之后，他po了一些关于车的视频，然后又讲述他为何要买这部车，一个月之内，他收到了超过2000个关于投资房地产的朋友申请。</li>
<li>这个月，他的学区房销售额翻了三倍。增长的销量的收入，两个月就让这部车的回本了。Nate的品味现在符合那些想要财务自由的投资者的预期，同时让他立即树立了威信，心理学家研究发现，这是一个主要的有说服力的因素</li>
<li>因为这辆新车，许多大客户开始来找他，他现在开始变的“可信”了，Nate开始作为重要角色被邀请到一些私人聚会中。你可能会说这看起来很浮躁，但你只说对了一半。</li>
<li>Nate自己的心理开始有了变化。开着酷酷的车在街上，让他感觉很好，他简直自信心爆棚</li>
</ol>
<p>心理学家描述了一种叫做pre-cognition的概念，就是说你能根据targeting biological 和 环境预测自己的心理和情绪。如果你想要放松，你会去寻找安多酚，去跑步或者冲个冷水澡。如果你想要平静下来，可以接触大自然。Nate的自信心之所以建立，因为几个原因</p>
<ol>
<li>首先，如前所述，他的环境给他创造了一个极好的感觉</li>
<li>第二，可能是最重要的一点，他看到了甜头，他给自己投资了一大笔钱，为的是告诉别人自己对自己的事业多么严肃，以及他对未来愿景有多么的向往。</li>
</ol>
<p>需要注意的是，Nate的自信心绝不仅仅只是来自于一辆特斯拉，真正的秘诀不可能在外部，而在于他的内心。是的，许多的人都搞混了内在与外在的界限，他们模糊不清，但其实这个是一个辩证关系，你中有我我中有你。</p>

<h1 id="《原》-Surround-Yourself-with-People-Who-Hold-You-to-a-Higher-Standard-than-You-Hold-Yourself"><a href="#《原》-Surround-Yourself-with-People-Who-Hold-You-to-a-Higher-Standard-than-You-Hold-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="《原》 Surround Yourself with People Who Hold You to a Higher Standard than You Hold Yourself"></a>《原》 Surround Yourself with People Who Hold You to a Higher Standard than You Hold Yourself</h1><p>Benjamin P. Hardy • Nov 11<br>There s some interesting research in social psychology explaining how most people form their peer groups. Especially as children and adolescence  but often as adults  people select their friends based on proximity more than anything else.<br>Even in a college classroom  who are you going to make friends with? It s not those who have similar personalities and interests. It s the people you literally sit next to.<br>Socioeconomically  there is loads of research showing a person s economic mobility is highly determined by the county they live in. In certain counties  your chances of improving your financial situation are very good. In others  like the county our three foster children came from  your chances of improving your financial situation are slim-to-none.<br>Put most simply  what stands in nearest proximity to you has enormous implications. As Jim Rohn has wisely said   You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.  Similarly  Tim Sanders  former Yahoo! director  said   Your network is your net worth.<br>If you re feeling stuck and struggling to make the progress you want  take a look around you. Most people adapt to whatever environment they find themselves. They have what psychologists call an  external locus of control  where they believe factors outside of them dictate the direction of their lives. Consequently  they don t take responsibility for shaping the environment that will ultimately shape them.<br>Who are the people in nearest proximity to you?<br>How did they become your peer group?<br>Was it on purpose or based on convenience?<br>Do these people hold you to a high standard?<br>Or  do they hold you to an even lower standard than you hold yourself?<br>The Fastest Way to Change Your Life<br>If you want to improve and succeed in your life  you need to surround yourself with people who have higher standards than you do. As Tony Robbins has said  your life is a reflection of your standards  or what you re willing to tolerate. Most people are willing to tolerate unhealthy relationships  poor finances  and jobs they hate. If not so  those things wouldn t be in their lives.<br>The common approach to personal growth and change is to exert more willpower  or to improve your mindset  or to be more gritty. And all of these things certainly have their place.<br>But if your environment radically contradicts the goals you re trying to pursue  your life will always be an uphill battle.<br>A much better and faster approach is to purposefully change your environment. For example  I have a friend  Nate  who is a successful real estate investor. He also sells real estate education products.<br>Despite making high six-figures  he s an extremely frugal guy. For years  he drove a beat up Toyota Camery from the 1990 s. The car ran great and the gas mileage was fantastic. But the car didn t create an environment of confidence in Nate s perspective clients.<br>He decided to upgrade his car to better match his business goals and vision in life. He spent over $110 000 on a decked- out Tesla.<br>Four very interesting things happened after he made this investment:</p>
<ol>
<li>MostofNate s platform ison Facebook. He often talks about the deals he s doing  or teaching financial/real estate principles. After getting his Tesla  and posting awesome videos of the car and posts teaching the philosophy of why he bought it  he got over 2 000 friend requests from people involved in real estate within a month.</li>
<li>Duringthatmonth thesalesofhis real estate education products tripled. This increase in sales allowed the car to be paid-off in just two months of when he purchased it. Nate s environment now matched the education products he was selling to people about building financial freedom. Also his environment now triggered immediate authority — which according to psychological research is one of the primary persuasive triggers.</li>
<li>Withhisnewcar someofthe biggest real estate investors and real estate education sales people in his area began reaching out to him. He was now seen as  credible.  Nate began being invited to private events with his role models. You could argue how surface level all of this is  and you d be half right.</li>
<li>Nate sownpsychologychanged. Driving around in the coolest car on the road made him feel awesome. His confidence shot through the roof.<br>Research in psychology describes a concept known as  pre-cognition   which shows that you can predict your own psychological/emotional state by targeting biological or environmental stimuli. If you want a release and rush of endorphins  go running and or take a ice- bath. If you want to feel peaceful go into nature. Nate s confidence shot through the roof for a few reasons.<br>Firstly  as noted  his environment created amazing feelings.<br>Secondly  and perhaps far more importantly  he was seeing the fruits of his labors. He was investing himself in big things and demonstrating to himself how serious he was about the work he was doing and the vision he was aspiring towards.<br>Thirdly  he was consciously generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in real-time. He created an environment that was now creating him. And the fruits were already apparent.<br>These fruits added even more confidence  creating a continuous confidence building feedback loop.<br>It s important to note that Nate s confidence doesn t come from owning a Tesla. True security is never external  but can only exist internally.<br>Yet  too many people separate the internal and external with fine lines. The lines are more blurred. The external and internal  in reality  play-off each other. When you change your external environment  it alters your psychology which then can loop back to continuing to enhance the environment in a virtuous upward cycle.<br>Surround Yourself With People Who Transform You<br>Over the past 10 or so months  I ve hired Ryan Holiday  author of several bestselling books  to help me with the book I m writing. Working with Ryan has shown me just how low my own standards for my work are. For instance every time I send him a draft  he shows me why and how it could be 10X better  and he holds me to that standard.<br>It s not that my standards are inherently low. It s more that I don t know what I don t know. Working with Ryan has streamlined my understanding of what is possible and what it takes to create something powerful.<br>Just like my friend s Tesla  I had to pay to improve my environment. At least when it comes to business  the best advice is rarely free. Moreover  it is only by investing in what you re doing that you ll experience the psychological shift needed to achieve your goals. Once invested  your identity towards what you are doing changes. You demonstrate to yourself that you have skin in the game. You ve put yourself physically  not just emotionally  in a position where you must move forward. The role of leadership becomes natural and instinctive. Survival and thriving become one in the same.<br>Surrounding yourself with people who have higher standards than you is the fastest way to change. In fact  I believe it s the only way to truly and permanently change. If you don t change your environment  and instead attempt to overcome your environment through willpower  you ll lose every time. Your progress will be very slow.<br>Are you surrounded by people who hold you to a high standard?<br>This Is True Of All Relationships  Especially Romantic<br>This isn t true just in working relationships. What about your romantic partner? Do they hold you to a high standard? Do they help you become more than you currently are? Do you help them?<br>The 80/20 rule applies to people and peer groups. 20 percent of the population is moving forward  60 percent of population reactively mimics whoever they are around at the time  and 20 percent of the population is moving backwards.<br>Most people are a direct reflection of those around them. If the people around them have lower standards  they drop theirs  as well. If the people around them have higher standards  they raise their game.<br>You ve been around people who  simply by being around them  elevated your thinking and energy. Those are the kinds of people you need to surround yourself with. Those are the kinds of people you need to be like yourself  so that others are better simply by being around you.<br>The quality of your life and the quality of your work is determined by the standards you have for yourself  and the standards of those around you. If you re fine doing mediocre work  than those around you are as well.<br>If you genuinely want to become better  you must surround yourself with people who will hold you to a higher standard than you currently hold yourself. You want to be around people with a higher and better vantage-point than you have  so that you can quickly learn from them.<br>Your level of talent and  potential  are irrelevant if you re surrounded by people who don t help you realize it. We all know many people who have unfulfilled potential. Don t let that be you.<br>Who you surround yourself with has huge consequences. You can t ignore this. What are you going to do about it?<br>Ready to Upgrade?<br>I ve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a peak state  immediately. If you follow this daily  you ll be able to proactively create the life you want.</li>
